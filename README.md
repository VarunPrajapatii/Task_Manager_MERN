This not a typical to-do list app that stores everything in local storage. What's fundamentally different is we're setting up the api that communicates 
with the cloud database that persists the data to the cloud. We enter a new task, we sends off the post request, we get all the 
tasks and new task is added to the list. We can delete and edit the task too. I have installed a lower version of mongoose, i.e. version 5, because 
its a practice project I am making, watching freeCodeCamp.org's youtube video...
